# Computer Science Variables

## Variable 

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information.

## Variables in Python

*Defined*

A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.

A Google search will yield many different lists of variable / data types available in Python. I think there are 8 the beginning programmer must be familiar with. I think there are two categories of variables, Simple and Complex.

### Simple variables

- Integer
- Floating-point number
- String
- Boolean

There are multiple methods for defining numbers including octal and hexadecimal.

### Complex variables

- List
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Set

### Others

Your search may yield the following types. In my teaching experience, we did not cover these and they may be recent additions to the language or for advanced programming.

- Frozenset
- Bytes
- Bytearray
- Complex

The string type/class is used to hold Unicode strings, and the bytes and bytearray classes are used to hold binary data.

Refer to Chapter 4 in the book "Python in a Nutshell" by Alex Martelli, published by O'Reilly. There you will find a fairly through explanation of the Python Language. This includes definition of variables.
