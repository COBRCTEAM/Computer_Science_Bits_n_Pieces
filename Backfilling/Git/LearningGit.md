# Bob's Git Guide

## So ?

You want to learn Git. What is Git? A collection of commands that will build a Version Control System (VCS).

I think all you need is to install the command set on a computer and have some method to access the command line. Viola, you can create and use a repository. Beyond the basics, you might be able to create and use branches at the command line.

At this level, there is no sharing, no remote repository (for redundancy) and no GUI. But, you do have the ability to move back and forth in time (a big thing by the way). 

To a large degree this started in the heady days of UNIX and Linux. Mostly folks wanted a tool to archive plain text files. These were mostly in three categories LaTeX, Shell scripts and C code. There are a few others, but the point is mostly ASCII text files. There were several options over time but the king today is Git. So learn it!

## Git ecosystem

There are options for moving from a local repository to a shared or redundant repository. These include a locally hosted, organizationally hosted, commercial or Open Source. Some of the cloud based repositories are:

- GitHub
- GitLab
-  ...

GitHub is a commercial platform owned by Microsoft and is probably the king of cloud based repositories.

## My confusion

There are a plethora of options for access to GitHub, there are options within Git  to move a project forward and there are many tools for editing the files to be archived.

Also there is the establishment of a logical workflow and collaboration model to be understood.

## Steps to learning Git & GitHub

### Knowledge gaps (Things I just don't know)

#### Explore and Document

- Git CLI
- GitHub (Browser Based)
- Branching and Pull Requests
- Tags and releases
- Project flow and communications or (logical workflow and collaboration model)
- GitHub Markdown syntax

#### Steps

- Getting Started. Learn and document the Git theory (model or philosophy). Why and how.
- Learn and document the CLI tools needed to do local work and play in the GitHub ecosystem.
- Document the encrypted secure ssh access to the GitHub repository. (Mostly Done).
- Learn and document creating and using branches.
- Focus on CLI and Browser based GitHub
