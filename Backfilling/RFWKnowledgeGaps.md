# Backfilling

While I have over 50 years in the IT industry, the industry is constantly evolving. 

I have become interested in the Open Source Model of software development over the years. This interest is coupled with my fascination with Xview, a friends software project from the late 1980's. Recently, I met a software engineer that was interested in the Xview software.

In order to cleanup the package as an open source project, I need to learn a lot of current technology. This segment of this repository is devoted to my learning.

## Goals

- Build an Open Source repository for the Xview software. (I have a rudimentary project plan).
- Learn Git and GitHub.
- Leverage Git and GitHub to move the Xview project forward.

## Knowledge gaps (Things I just don't know)

- Git CLI
- GitHub (Browser Based)
- Branching and Pull Requests
- Tags and releases
- Project flow and communications or (logical workflow and collaboration model)
- GitHub the iOS app -- some of the browser based features
- Working Copy -- the iOS repository host
- C programming
- Make -- powerful scripting language for building and testing software
- Editing tools: 
	- Textastic -- the iOS editor of choice with interface to Working Copy and UNIX servers via scp.
	- vi, vim and/or emacs (CLI)
	- Textastic (iOS and MacOS)
	- Editing tools in GitHub browser based
	- Editing tools in GitHub the iOS app
	- Editing tools in Working Copy
- Drafts -- The beginning point for all text and Markdown editor
- Drafts -- Advanced using a master file with links to other Drafts files to produce a combined document.
- GitHub Markdown syntax
- Other stuff
## My plan

### Early Phases

- Getting Started. Learn and document the Git theory (model or philosophy). Why and how.
- Learn and document the CLI tools needed to do local work and play in the GitHub ecosystem.
- Document the encrypted secure ssh access to the GitHub repository. (Mostly Done).
- Learn and document creating and using branches.
- Focus on CLI and Browser based GitHub
- Commence learning C and building of C applications using Make
- Re-learn sed to change the make files from cc to $(CC).
- Document in the repository the use of $(CC) and how to set CC to use cc -ansi.

### Future work

- Achieving a clean compile of all Xview software using cc -ansi
- Release of Xview 1.0
- ANSIfication of Xview
- Release of Xview 2.0
- Rest on Laurels?
- Search for next project.
